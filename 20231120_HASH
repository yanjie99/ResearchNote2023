What are Hash functions: A hash function is simply a function that takes in input value, and from that input creates an output value deterministic of the input value.
For any x input value, you will always receive the same y output value whenever the hash function is run.
Note: Hashes are often used in this context of varifying information without revealing it to the party that is verifying.

A Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain. The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem. The number must be difficult to find but easy to verify--computationally speaking--by anyone on the network.
Difficult to solve but easy to velify.

Crypto-currency
cryptographic hash function: (1) collision resistance (collision free). [x != y, H(x) = H (y)]   
                             (2) hiding. [x, H(x); but H(x) can not to x]
Digital commitment (Digital equivalent of a sealed envelope) 
                             (3) puzzle friendly. H(x+nounce)
